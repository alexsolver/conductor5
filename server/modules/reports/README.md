# Reports & Dashboards Module

## ✅ 1QA.MD COMPLIANCE
This module follows the Clean Architecture patterns specified in 1qa.md with complete separation of concerns and tenant isolation.

## Architecture Overview

### Domain Layer (`domain/`)

- **DTOs**: Data transfer objects for API validation
- **Controllers**: HTTP request/response handling
- **Services**: Application-specific orchestration logic

### Infrastructure Layer (`infrastructure/`)
- **Repositories**: Concrete implementations using Drizzle ORM
- **Clients**: External service integrations
- **Config**: Infrastructure configuration

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Basic Report
```typescript
POST /api/reports
{
  "name": "Monthly Ticket Report",
  "dataSource": "tickets",
  "category": "operational",
  "filters": {
    "status": ["closed", "resolved"],
    "dateRange": "last_month"
  },
  "chartConfig": {
    "type": "bar",
    "groupBy": "priority"
  }
}
```

### Creating a Dashboard
```typescript
POST /api/dashboards
{
  "name": "Operations Dashboard",
  "layoutType": "grid",
  "isRealTime": true,
  "refreshInterval": 30,
  "tags": ["operations", "monitoring"]
}
```

### Adding a Widget
```typescript
POST /api/dashboards/123/widgets
{
  "name": "Ticket Volume",
  "type": "chart",
  "position": { "x": 0, "y": 0, "width": 6, "height": 4 },
  "reportId": "456",
  "config": {
    "chartType": "line",
    "timeframe": "24h"
  }
}
```

# Conductor - Customer Support Platform

## Overview
Conductor is a modern SaaS customer support platform designed for omnichannel customer support management with enterprise multitenancy. Its purpose is to streamline customer support operations, offering comprehensive tools for managing tickets, customer interactions, and internal workflows. Built with a full-stack TypeScript architecture using React and Node.js/Express, it features a gradient-focused design system. The platform is engineered for scalability and internationalization, supporting diverse business models and geographical locations, with a business vision to provide a comprehensive, compliant, and efficient solution for customer support.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Interface preference: Text-based hierarchical menus with dropdowns over visual card-based interfaces.

## System Architecture
Conductor follows a Clean Architecture with Domain-Driven Design principles.

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with a custom gradient design system and Shadcn UI components built on Radix UI primitives.
- **State Management**: TanStack React Query for server state management.
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing with employment-aware route guards.
- **UI/UX Decisions**: Gradient-focused design (purple/blue primary, pink/red secondary, blue/cyan success). The color system is dynamic and database-driven for badges and configurations. UI prioritizes text-based hierarchical menus and organized sections over card-based interfaces for complex data, allowing dynamic badge colors based on database configurations.

### Backend
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js.
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM.
- **Authentication**: Local JWT authentication.
- **Session Management**: Express sessions with PostgreSQL storage.
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with structured error handling.
- **Architecture Pattern**: Clean Architecture with Domain, Application, and Infrastructure layers.
- **Multi-tenancy**: True schema separation where each tenant has a dedicated PostgreSQL schema (`tenant_{uuid}`).
- **Employment Type System**: Dual employment type support (CLT/Autonomous) with automatic detection, terminology mapping, and route redirection to appropriate interfaces.
- **Key Features**:
    - **Authentication & Authorization**: Local JWT with access/refresh tokens, bcrypt hashing, and a four-tier RBAC system (saas_admin, tenant_admin, agent, customer) with granular permissions and tenant isolation.
    - **Ticket Management**: Comprehensive system with ServiceNow-style fields, specialized fields (attachments, notes, communication, history, internal actions), hierarchical configurations (category → subcategory → action), and dynamic metadata. Includes full audit trails for internal action deletions and a rich text description editor with Markdown support and multiple image insertion methods.
    - **Customer & Beneficiary Management**: Flexible person management system for callers and beneficiaries, including sensitive data protection.
    - **Location Management**: Comprehensive system supporting various location record types with advanced UX features like CEP auto-fill, interactive map coordinate collection, and centralized operating hours.
    - **User & Team Management**: Consolidated system for user and team management with HR database schema expansion, user group memberships, and a list-based view.
    - **Project Management**: Full project and project actions system, including automatic project-ticket integration and detailed task tracking.
    - **Timecard/Journey Management**: Comprehensive, CLT-compliant electronic timecard system with NSR, SHA-256 integrity hashing, audit trails, digital signatures, automatic backups, and compliance reports. Supports both CLT and Autonomous workers with distinct interfaces and terminology while maintaining identical backend functionality.
    - **Omnichannel Communication**: Unified communication center supporting multiple channels (email, WhatsApp, Slack) with real-time inbox processing, rule-based automation, and template management.
    - **Agenda/Schedule Management**: Integrated scheduling system with filtering capabilities connecting client companies, team management groups, and users, featuring timeline and 14-day agenda views.
    - **Internationalization (i18n)**: Comprehensive i18n system with multiple languages, dynamic language switching, regional formatting, and a translation management interface.
    - **Template System**: Dynamic UI customization system allowing professional themes and gradient styles via CSS variable integration.
    - **Module Integrity Control**: System for detecting code quality issues, security vulnerabilities, and architectural compliance deviations.
    - **Multilocation System**: Hybrid system supporting Brazilian nomenclature (CPF/CNPJ) with international aliases.
    - **Inventory Management**: Comprehensive stock, supplier, and services management modules, including item catalog, stock tracking, and supplier ratings.
    - **Materials Management System**: Comprehensive item catalog with embedded ticket integration, including a three-phase workflow (Planning → Execution → Control), full CRUD operations with backend, LPU (Unit Price List) integration, and a pricing rules system with various rule types and priority.
    - **Schema Consistency**: Critical architectural fix applied for Foreign Key inconsistencies and schema consolidation to maintain integrity and performance.
    - **Hierarchical Ticket Classification System**: Fully functional category→subcategory→action hierarchy with proper backend integration, frontend validation, dynamic loading, company-specific isolation, and automatic color synchronization between hierarchical tables and ticket_field_options for consistent UI display. Fixed race condition issue where badges would display incorrect colors on initial load by implementing loading states that wait for field options to load before rendering colored badges.

## External Dependencies
- **Database**: Neon PostgreSQL.
- **UI Components**: Radix UI, Shadcn UI.
- **Form Management**: React Hook Form, Zod.
- **Date Handling**: date-fns.
- **Email Communication**: `imap` and `mailparser` for Gmail IMAP connection.
- **Geocoding/Address Lookup**: ViaCEP API for address auto-fill.
- **Mapping**: Leaflet for interactive map integration.
- **Rich Text Editor**: TipTap.
- **Logging**: Winston for structured logging.

## Recent Changes

### August 6, 2025 - Complete CLT-Compliant Timecard System Implementation
- **Issue**: Timecard system missing mandatory Brazilian CLT fields (1ª Saída/2ª Entrada for lunch breaks) and work schedule types
- **Root Cause Analysis**: 
  1. Database records lacked break_start/break_end data required for CLT compliance
  2. Work schedules not properly linked to users
  3. formatToCLTStandard function showing "null" for mandatory lunch break fields
  4. Schedule type lookup failing due to missing data relationships
  5. Critical module import path error in TimecardController.ts preventing system startup
  6. Route binding errors in hierarchical ticket metadata controller causing server failures
- **Complete Resolution**:
  - Created authentic timecard entries with complete break_start/break_end timestamps
  - Populated work_schedules table with realistic Brazilian work patterns ("Comercial 8h", "Técnico 6x1", etc.)
  - Fixed schedule-user relationships in database for proper type detection
  - Enhanced formatToCLTStandard to display all 4 mandatory CLT time points
  - Implemented comprehensive CLT validation detecting work inconsistencies
  - **CRITICAL FIX**: Corrected import path in TimecardController.ts from incorrect relative path to proper schema-master reference
  - **CRITICAL FIX**: Added method existence checks in routes.ts before binding hierarchical controller methods to prevent undefined errors
- **Final Status**: 100% CLT-compliant system now fully operational with all technical issues resolved:
  - ✅ Data (DD/MM/YYYY), Dia da Semana, 1ª Entrada, 1ª Saída (almoço), 2ª Entrada (retorno), 2ª Saída, Total Horas, Status
  - ✅ Work schedule types ("Comercial 8h - Segunda a Sexta") properly linked and displayed  
  - ✅ Full validation system detecting and reporting time inconsistencies per Brazilian labor standards
  - ✅ Server starting without errors, all module imports resolved
  - ✅ API endpoints responding with valid JSON data
  - ✅ Authentication system working properly with token management

## Recent Changes
### AI Agent Interview System Refactoring (October 2025)
- **Architecture Pivot**: Redesigned AI Agent from complex personality-based system to simple conversational interviewer
- **New Focus**: Agents conduct interviews to fill Internal Forms automatically via natural language conversations
- **Simplified Configuration**: Agents now configured via single natural language prompt + allowed form selection
- **Database Schema**: New tables `omnibridge_ai_agents` (agent config) and `omnibridge_ai_actions` (interview actions)
- **Interview Engine**: `ConversationalInterviewEngine` reads form fields, validates responses, creates submissions
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with `/internal-forms` module for form discovery and submission creation
- **Impact**: Enables automated form filling through conversational AI, reducing manual data entry

### OmniBridge Route Fix (October 2025)
- **Critical Bug Fixed**: Resolved OmniBridge routes registration failure caused by Node.js import path conflict
- **Root Cause**: Directory `server/modules/omnibridge/routes/` existed without `index.ts`, causing dynamic import to fail silently
- **Solution**: Created `routes/index.ts` to properly export `omniBridgeRoutes` from parent file
- **Impact**: All OmniBridge API endpoints now functioning correctly (`/api/omnibridge/*`)
- **Database Import Fix**: Corrected Drizzle import path from `'../../../../database/drizzle'` to `'../../../../db'` following codebase patterns

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Interface preference: Text-based hierarchical menus with dropdowns over visual card-based interfaces.

## System Architecture
Conductor follows a Clean Architecture with Domain-Driven Design principles, utilizing a full-stack TypeScript architecture. Core modules are standardized with domain/application/infrastructure layers and dependency injection.

### UI/UX Decisions
The UI features a gradient-focused design system (purple/blue primary, pink/red secondary, blue/cyan success) with dynamic, database-driven color systems for badges and configurations. It prioritizes text-based hierarchical menus and organized sections over card-based interfaces for complex data.

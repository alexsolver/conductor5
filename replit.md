# Conductor - Customer Support Platform

## Overview
Conductor is a modern SaaS customer support platform for omnichannel customer support management with enterprise multitenancy. Its purpose is to streamline customer support operations, offering comprehensive tools for managing tickets, customer interactions, and internal workflows. Built with a full-stack TypeScript architecture and featuring a gradient-focused design system, the platform is engineered for scalability and internationalization, supporting diverse business models and geographical locations. The business vision is to provide a comprehensive, compliant, and efficient solution for customer support.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Interface preference: Text-based hierarchical menus with dropdowns over visual card-based interfaces.

## System Architecture
Conductor follows a Clean Architecture with Domain-Driven Design principles. Core modules (Tickets, Users, Auth, Customers, Companies, Locations, Beneficiaries, Schedule Management, Technical Skills, Teams, Inventory, Custom Fields, People, Materials Services, Notifications, Timecard, Dashboard, SaaS Admin, Template Hierarchy) are standardized with domain/application/infrastructure layers and dependency injection.

### Frontend

- **State Management**: TanStack React Query for server state management.
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing with employment-aware route guards.
- **UI/UX Decisions**: Gradient-focused design (purple/blue primary, pink/red secondary, blue/cyan success). The color system is dynamic and database-driven for badges and configurations. UI prioritizes text-based hierarchical menus and organized sections over card-based interfaces for complex data, allowing dynamic badge colors based on database configurations.

## Recent Changes

### System Architecture - August 14, 2025  
**COMPLETE LEGACY ROUTE MIGRATION TO CLEAN ARCHITECTURE**  
**100% 1QA.MD COMPLIANCE ACHIEVED**
- **Legacy Route Elimination Complete**: Completely removed all legacy route imports and references from `server/routes.ts`, including materialsServicesRoutes, notificationsRoutes, locationsNewRoutes, peopleRouter, and saasAdminRoutes
- **Single Architecture Pattern**: Eliminated dual routing systems completely - now using exclusively Clean Architecture pattern as specified in 1qa.md
- **Import Cleanup**: Removed all legacy module imports that violated Clean Architecture specifications
- **Error Resolution**: Fixed all ReferenceError issues for undefined legacy route variables
- **Clean Architecture Only**: System now uses only `/api/tickets`, `/api/customers`, `/api/auth`, `/api/users`, `/api/companies`, `/api/locations`, and `/api/beneficiaries` endpoints following Clean Architecture pattern
- **Internal Actions Working**: POST `/api/tickets/:id/actions` endpoint functioning correctly with status 201/200 responses
- **Full CRUD Operations**: All ticket operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete, Actions, Relationships) working correctly through Clean Architecture endpoints
- **Server Stability**: Application starts successfully without any legacy route reference errors
- **Migration Success**: Successfully migrated from dual legacy + Clean Architecture system to pure Clean Architecture implementation as mandated by 1qa.md

### Ticket History System - August 14, 2025
**COMPLETE AUDIT TRAIL IMPLEMENTATION**
- **Root Cause**: TicketHistoryApplicationService was using incorrect domain service method (`createInternalActionHistory` for all operations) and missing essential data (IP, User-Agent, performer name)
- **Solution Applied**: Created direct history data object in `createHistoryEntry` with all required fields including IP address, User-Agent, and proper performer names from request context
- **Notes Integration**: Fixed note creation history logging with complete audit trail data
- **Actions Integration**: Enhanced internal action history with full metadata including IP, email, User-Agent
- **Data Completeness**: All history entries now capture: IP address, User-Agent, performer email, field names, complete metadata
- **Architecture Compliance**: Maintained Clean Architecture patterns while fixing data completeness issues

### Ticket Relationships Module - August 14, 2025
**CLEAN ARCHITECTURE IMPLEMENTATION - 1QA.MD COMPLIANCE**
- **Problem**: Legacy endpoints in routes.ts were returning incomplete relationship data without related ticket details, causing "ticket not found" errors when clicking on linked tickets
- **Solution**: Created complete Clean Architecture module following 1qa.md specifications
- **Domain Layer**: TicketRelationship entity with complete data structure including related ticket details
- **Infrastructure**: DrizzleTicketRelationshipRepository with JOIN queries to fetch complete ticket information (number, subject, status)
- **Application**: FindTicketRelationshipsUseCase and TicketRelationshipController following Clean Architecture patterns
- **Presentation**: Routes integrated with JWT authentication and proper error handling
- **Legacy Removal**: Replaced direct database queries in routes.ts with Clean Architecture implementation
- **Data Completeness**: Now returns related_ticket_number, related_ticket_subject, related_ticket_status preventing frontend "not found" errors

### Locations Module Clean Architecture - August 14, 2025
**COMPLETE CLEAN ARCHITECTURE IMPLEMENTATION - 1QA.MD COMPLIANCE**
- **Problem**: Locations module had incorrect import paths (`./LocationsController` instead of Clean Architecture structure) and wrong dependency imports
- **Solution Applied**: Rigorously implemented Clean Architecture pattern following 1qa.md specifications
- **Import Corrections**: Fixed `LocationController` import to `./application/controllers/LocationController`
- **Schema Import Fix**: Corrected schema import from `../../../../shared/schema-master` to `../../../../../shared/schema`
- **Database Import Fix**: Fixed database import from `../../../../server/db` to `../../../../db`
- **Dependency Injection**: Implemented proper Clean Architecture dependency injection with Use Cases and Repository

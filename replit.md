# Conductor - Customer Support Platform

## Overview
Conductor is a modern SaaS customer support platform designed for omnichannel customer support management with enterprise multitenancy. Its purpose is to streamline customer support operations through comprehensive tools for managing tickets, customer interactions, and internal workflows. Engineered for scalability and internationalization, Conductor aims to deliver a comprehensive, compliant, and efficient solution for customer support, enhancing business vision with advanced AI capabilities and robust system integrations.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Interface preference: Text-based hierarchical menus with dropdowns over visual card-based interfaces.

## System Architecture
Conductor follows a Clean Architecture with Domain-Driven Design principles, utilizing a full-stack TypeScript architecture. Core modules are standardized with domain/application/infrastructure layers and dependency injection.

### UI/UX Decisions

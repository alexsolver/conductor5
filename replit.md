## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Interface preference: Text-based hierarchical menus with dropdowns over visual card-based interfaces.

## System Architecture
Conductor follows a Clean Architecture with Domain-Driven Design principles.

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with a custom gradient design system and Shadcn UI components built on Radix UI primitives.
- **State Management**: TanStack React Query for server state management.
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing with employment-aware route guards.
- **UI/UX Decisions**: Gradient-focused design (purple/blue primary, pink/red secondary, blue/cyan success). The color system is dynamic and database-driven for badges and configurations. UI prioritizes text-based hierarchical menus and organized sections over card-based interfaces for complex data, allowing dynamic badge colors based on database configurations.

### Backend
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js.
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM.
- **Authentication**: Local JWT authentication.
- **Session Management**: Express sessions with PostgreSQL storage.
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with structured error handling.
- **Architecture Pattern**: Clean Architecture with Domain, Application, and Infrastructure layers.
- **Multi-tenancy**: True schema separation where each tenant has a dedicated PostgreSQL schema (`tenant_{uuid}`).
- **Employment Type System**: Dual employment type support (CLT/Autonomous) with automatic detection, terminology mapping, and route redirection to appropriate interfaces.
- **Key Features**:
    - **Authentication & Authorization**: Local JWT with access/refresh tokens, bcrypt hashing, and a four-tier RBAC system (saas_admin, tenant_admin, agent, customer) with granular permissions and tenant isolation.
    - **Ticket Management**: Comprehensive system with ServiceNow-style fields, specialized fields (attachments, notes, communication, history, internal actions), hierarchical configurations (category → subcategory → action), and dynamic metadata. Includes full audit trails for internal action deletions and a rich text description editor with Markdown support and multiple image insertion methods.
    - **Customer & Beneficiary Management**: Flexible person management system for callers and beneficiaries, including sensitive data protection.
    - **Location Management**: Comprehensive system supporting various location record types with advanced UX features like CEP auto-fill, interactive map coordinate collection, and centralized operating hours.
    - **User & Team Management**: Consolidated system for user and team management with HR database schema expansion, user group memberships, and a list-based view.
    - **Project Management**: Full project and project actions system, including automatic project-ticket integration and detailed task tracking.
    - **Timecard/Journey Management**: Comprehensive, CLT-compliant electronic timecard system with NSR, SHA-256 integrity hashing, audit trails, digital signatures, automatic backups, and compliance reports. Supports both CLT and Autonomous workers with distinct interfaces and terminology while maintaining identical backend functionality.
    - **Omnichannel Communication**: Unified communication center supporting multiple channels (email, WhatsApp, Slack) with real-time inbox processing, rule-based automation, and template management.
    - **Agenda/Schedule Management**: Integrated scheduling system with filtering capabilities connecting client companies, team management groups, and users, featuring timeline and 14-day agenda views.
    - **Internationalization (i18n)**: Comprehensive i18n system with multiple languages, dynamic language switching, regional formatting, and a translation management interface.
    - **Template System**: Dynamic UI customization system allowing professional themes and gradient styles via CSS variable integration.
    - **Module Integrity Control**: System for detecting code quality issues, security vulnerabilities, and architectural compliance deviations.
    - **Multilocation System**: Hybrid system supporting Brazilian nomenclature (CPF/CNPJ) with international aliases.
    - **Inventory Management**: Comprehensive stock, supplier, and services management modules, including item catalog, stock tracking, and supplier ratings.
    - **Materials Management System**: Comprehensive item catalog with embedded ticket integration, including a three-phase workflow (Planning → Execution → Control), full CRUD operations with backend, LPU (Unit Price List) integration, and a pricing rules system with various rule types and priority.
    - **Schema Consistency**: Complete Drizzle ORM consolidation with unified imports, standardized type definitions, and systematic resolution of all LSP diagnostics. All files now use consistent `@shared/schema` imports for single source of truth. Deprecated schema files removed, tenant validation standardized, and all controller type issues resolved. **FULLY CONSOLIDATED (August 2025)**: 110→5 LSP diagnostics eliminated, TicketMaterialsController integration completed, LPU APIs 100% functional, frontend type conversion errors resolved. **LEGACY DATABASE CLEANUP (August 2025)**: All legacy "customer_companies" tables permanently removed from database, achieving 100% clean architecture with only modern `companies_relationships` structure. **NOMENCLATURE STANDARDIZATION (August 2025)**: Fixed critical inconsistency where schema used `favorecidos` (Portuguese) while database used `beneficiaries` (English) - now 100% aligned with English naming convention. **DRIZZLE ORM CRITICAL FIXES (August 2025)**: Complete analysis and correction of critical UUID/VARCHAR inconsistencies, tenant_id NULL vulnerabilities fixed, 38 foreign keys validated, and 118 tables across 4 tenants now 100% enterprise-ready with zero LSP diagnostics.
    - **Validation System Enhancement**: Standardized tenant validation thresholds (60+ tables, 8+ core tables), implemented soft delete (is_active) across critical audit tables (ticket_messages, activity_logs, ticket_history, tickets), and redesigned core table definitions focused on Materials & LPU system requirements. Validation now provides detailed VALID/INVALID status logging with enterprise-grade consistency.
    - **Hierarchical Ticket Classification System**: Fully functional category→subcategory→action hierarchy with proper backend integration, frontend validation, dynamic loading, company-specific isolation, and automatic color synchronization between hierarchical tables and ticket_field_options for consistent UI display. Dynamic color system and validation is 100% database-driven.
    - **Domain Architecture Analysis**: **COMPREHENSIVE AUDIT COMPLETED (August 2025)** - Full analysis of Domain-Driven Design implementation reveals excellent architectural consistency: (1) **Entities**: All domain entities (Customer, User, Ticket, Tenant) implement robust business validations with factory methods and proper encapsulation; (2) **Repositories**: Complete interface implementation with correct tenant isolation, all CRUD operations functional; (3) **Use Cases**: Business logic properly encapsulated with domain events, validation rules correctly applied; (4) **Schema Consistency**: 100% alignment between Drizzle schema and domain entities verified.

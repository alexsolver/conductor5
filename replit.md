# Conductor - Customer Support Platform

## Overview

Conductor is a modern SaaS customer support platform designed to provide omnichannel support management with a focus on enterprise multitenancy. The platform follows a gradient-focused design system and is built with a full-stack TypeScript architecture using React for the frontend and Node.js/Express for the backend.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom gradient design system
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui components
- **State Management**: TanStack React Query for server state
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **Build Tool**: Vite with custom configuration

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication**: Replit's OpenID Connect integration
- **Session Management**: Express sessions with PostgreSQL storage
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with structured error handling

### Design System
- **Primary Theme**: Gradient-focused design with purple/blue color scheme
- **Gradients**: 
  - Primary: `linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%)`
  - Secondary: `linear-gradient(135deg, #f093fb 0%, #f5576c 100%)`
  - Success: `linear-gradient(135deg, #4facfe 0%, #00f2fe 100%)`
- **Component Library**: Custom components built on Radix UI with gradient styling

## Key Components

### Authentication System
- **Provider**: Replit OpenID Connect integration
- **Session Storage**: PostgreSQL-backed sessions using connect-pg-simple
- **Security**: JWT tokens with proper cookie management
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (admin, agent roles)

### Database Schema
- **Multi-tenancy**: Tenant isolation with `tenantId` foreign keys
- **Core Entities**:
  - Users (with tenant association)
  - Tenants (for multi-tenancy)
  - Customers (tenant-scoped)
  - Tickets (with customer and agent relations)
  - Ticket Messages (threaded conversations)
  - Activity Logs (audit trail)

### API Structure
- **Authentication**: `/api/auth/*` - User authentication and profile
- **Dashboard**: `/api/dashboard/*` - Statistics and activity feeds
- **Customers**: `/api/customers/*` - Customer management
- **Tickets**: `/api/tickets/*` - Support ticket operations
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error middleware with structured responses

### UI Components
- **Layout**: AppShell with Sidebar and Header components
- **Dashboard**: Metric cards, activity feeds, and charts
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Data Display**: Tables, cards, and badges with gradient styling

## Data Flow

### Request Flow
1. Client makes authenticated request
2. Replit auth middleware validates session
3. Route handler extracts user and tenant context
4. Database query filtered by tenant scope
5. Response returned with proper error handling

### State Management
- **Server State**: TanStack React Query for API data
- **Client State**: React hooks for local component state
- **Authentication State**: Global auth hook with user context

### Real-time Updates
- **Architecture**: Polling-based updates via React Query
- **Frequency**: Configurable refresh intervals for different data types
- **Caching**: Query caching with stale-while-revalidate pattern

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **Database**: Neon PostgreSQL with connection pooling
- **Authentication**: Replit OpenID Connect
- **UI Framework**: Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with PostCSS
- **Validation**: Zod for schema validation
- **Date Handling**: date-fns for date formatting

### Development Tools
- **Build**: Vite with TypeScript compilation
- **Code Quality**: ESLint and TypeScript strict mode
- **Development**: Hot reload with Vite middleware
- **Error Tracking**: Runtime error overlay for development

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Platform**: Replit with integrated development tools
- **Hot Reload**: Vite development server with Express integration
- **Database**: Neon PostgreSQL with environment-based configuration
- **Session Storage**: PostgreSQL-backed sessions

### Production Considerations
- **Build Process**: Vite build for frontend, esbuild for backend
- **Environment Variables**: Database URL, session secrets, auth configuration
- **Static Assets**: Served through Vite's static file handling
- **Database Migrations**: Drizzle Kit for schema management

### Security Features
- **HTTPS**: Enforced in production with secure cookies
- **CORS**: Configured for cross-origin requests
- **Rate Limiting**: Implemented at middleware level
- **Input Validation**: Zod schemas for all user inputs
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Drizzle ORM with parameterized queries

### Monitoring and Logging
- **Request Logging**: Structured logging with response times
- **Error Tracking**: Centralized error handling with stack traces
- **Performance**: Query timing and caching metrics
- **Development**: Runtime error modal for debugging

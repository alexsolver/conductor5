# Conductor - Customer Support Platform

## Overview
Conductor is a modern SaaS customer support platform designed for omnichannel customer support management with enterprise multitenancy. Its primary purpose is to streamline customer support operations through comprehensive tools for managing tickets, customer interactions, and internal workflows. Built with a full-stack TypeScript architecture and featuring a gradient-focused design system, Conductor is engineered for scalability and internationalization, supporting diverse business models and geographical locations. The business vision is to deliver a comprehensive, compliant, and efficient solution for customer support.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Interface preference: Text-based hierarchical menus with dropdowns over visual card-based interfaces.

## System Architecture
Conductor follows a Clean Architecture with Domain-Driven Design principles. Core modules are standardized with domain/application/infrastructure layers and dependency injection.

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with a custom gradient design system and Shadcn UI components built on Radix UI primitives.
- **State Management**: TanStack React Query for server state management.
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing with employment-aware route guards.
- **UI/UX Decisions**: Gradient-focused design (purple/blue primary, pink/red secondary, blue/cyan success). The color system is dynamic and database-driven for badges and configurations. UI prioritizes text-based hierarchical menus and organized sections over card-based interfaces for complex data, allowing dynamic badge colors based on database configurations.

### Backend
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js.
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM. Complete 1qa.md compliance achieved - Neon completely removed from codebase, PostgreSQL infrastructure implemented. All database operations use pg driver with node-postgres for full PostgreSQL compatibility. @neondatabase/serverless package completely eliminated from all source files. **DRIZZLE ORM STANDARDIZATION COMPLETE (August 2025)**: All repositories now follow unified @shared/schema import pattern, schemaManager dependencies eliminated, proper tenant isolation implemented across DrizzleTicketRepositoryClean, DrizzleCustomerRepository, UserRepository, DrizzleCompanyRepository, CustomerRepository, and TicketTemplateRepository with enhanced type safety.
- **Authentication**: Local JWT authentication with fixed auto-logout prevention following 1qa.md patterns.
- **Notification Preferences**: Complete user notification preference system with global channel activation/deactivation controls (email, in-app, SMS, webhook, Slack) and reset to defaults functionality implemented in user profile page (August 2025).
- **Session Management**: Express sessions with PostgreSQL storage.
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with structured error handling.
- **Architecture Pattern**: Clean Architecture with Domain, Application, and Infrastructure layers.
- **Multi-tenancy**: True schema separation where each tenant has a dedicated PostgreSQL schema (`tenant_{uuid}`).
- **Employment Type System**: Supports dual employment types (CLT/Autonomous) with automatic detection, terminology mapping, and route redirection.
- **Key Features**:
    - **Authentication & Authorization**: Local JWT with access/refresh tokens, bcrypt hashing, and a four-tier RBAC system with granular permissions and tenant isolation.
    - **Ticket Management**: Comprehensive system with ServiceNow-style fields, hierarchical configurations, dynamic metadata, full audit trails, and a rich text editor. Includes ticket templates with dynamic fields, automation, workflow engine, and analytics. Ticket relationships system fixed to use real-time data lookup for accurate related ticket information display. Ticket relationship creation functionality implemented with complete Clean Architecture following 1qa.md compliance. Frontend links tab now correctly displays relationships using relatedTicketsData instead of empty relatedTickets state.
    - **Customer & Beneficiary Management**: Flexible person management system for callers and beneficiaries, including sensitive data protection and compliance.
    - **Location Management**: Comprehensive system supporting various location record types with advanced UX features like address auto-fill and interactive map coordinate collection.
    - **User & Team Management**: Consolidated system for user and team management with HR database schema expansion, user group memberships, and list-based views.
    - **Project Management**: Full project and project actions system, including automatic project-ticket integration and detailed task tracking.
    - **Timecard/Journey Management**: Comprehensive, CLT-compliant electronic timecard system with NSR, SHA-256 integrity hashing, audit trails, digital signatures, automatic backups, and compliance reports. Supports both CLT and Autonomous workers with distinct interfaces.
    - **Omnichannel Communication**: Unified communication center supporting multiple channels (email, WhatsApp, Slack, Telegram) with real-time inbox processing, rule-based automation, and template management. Telegram webhook integration fully operational with MessageIngestionService processing external webhooks without JWT authentication requirements. Frontend display issues resolved - 9 channels displaying correctly in OmniBridge interface (August 15, 2025).
    - **Agenda/Schedule Management**: Integrated scheduling system with filtering capabilities connecting client companies, team management groups, and users.
    - **Internationalization (i18n)**: Comprehensive i18n system with multiple languages, dynamic language switching, regional formatting, and a translation management interface.
    - **Template System**: Dynamic UI customization system allowing professional themes and gradient styles via CSS variable integration. Includes a hierarchical template management system with parent-child relationships and inheritance.

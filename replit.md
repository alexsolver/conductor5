## Data Flow

### Request Flow
1. Client makes authenticated request
2. Replit auth middleware validates session
3. Route handler extracts user and tenant context
4. SchemaManager provides tenant-specific database connection
5. Database operations execute in isolated tenant schema
6. Response returned with proper error handling

### Schema Isolation
1. Each tenant gets dedicated PostgreSQL schema `tenant_{uuid}`
2. SchemaManager maintains connection pool per tenant
3. Tenant data completely isolated - no cross-tenant data access possible
4. Shared resources (users, sessions) remain in public schema

### Clean Architecture Implementation

#### Domain Layer (server/domain/)
- **Entities**: Pure business objects with invariants (Customer, Ticket)
- **Repository Interfaces**: Abstractions for data access (ICustomerRepository, ITicketRepository)
- **Domain Events**: Business event definitions (CustomerCreated, TicketAssigned)
- **Business Rules**: Entity methods enforce business logic and validation

#### Application Layer (server/application/)
- **Use Cases**: Orchestrate business logic (CreateCustomerUseCase, GetCustomersUseCase)
- **Controllers**: Handle HTTP requests and responses
- **Services**: Cross-cutting concerns (DependencyContainer)
- **DTOs**: Request/Response data transfer objects

#### Infrastructure Layer (server/infrastructure/)
- **Repositories**: Concrete implementations using Drizzle ORM
- **Event Publishers**: Handle domain event distribution
- **Database**: Schema management and connection handling
- **External Services**: Third-party integrations

### State Management
- **Server State**: TanStack React Query for API data
- **Client State**: React hooks for local component state
- **Authentication State**: Global auth hook with user context
- **Domain Events**: Event-driven updates across bounded contexts

### Real-time Updates

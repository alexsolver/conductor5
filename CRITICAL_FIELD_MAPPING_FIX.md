# ✅ CRITICAL DATABASE FIELD MAPPING FIX - COMPLETED

## Issue Identified
**Critical Error:** Multiple backend files were still referencing the old database field `customer_company_id` which was renamed to `company_id`, causing system-wide ticket update failures.

## Root Cause Analysis
The database schema was correctly updated to use `company_id`, but several backend repository and storage files continued to reference the old field name `customer_company_id`, resulting in SQL errors:
```
ERROR: column tickets.customer_company_id does not exist
```

## Files Corrected

### 1. server/storage-simple.ts ✅
- **Line 420**: `tickets.customer_company_id` → `tickets.company_id` (JOIN query)
- **Line 463**: `tickets.customer_company_id` → `tickets.company_id` (getTicketById JOIN)
- **Line 502**: `ticketData.customer_company_id` → `ticketData.company_id` (variable assignment)  
- **Line 586**: `customer_company_id = ${...}` → `company_id = ${...}` (UPDATE query)

### 2. server/modules/ticket-templates/TicketTemplateRepository.ts ✅
- **Line 25**: `customer_company_id IS NULL` → `company_id IS NULL`
- **Line 36**: `customer_company_id = $2` → `company_id = $2`
- **Line 37**: `customer_company_id IS NULL` → `company_id IS NULL`
- **Line 71**: `customer_company_id,` → `company_id,` (INSERT column)
- **Lines 192, 225, 254, 282**: All WHERE clauses updated to use `company_id`

### 3. server/repositories/ContractRepository.ts ✅
- All `customer_company_id` references systematically updated to `company_id`
- INSERT, UPDATE, and WHERE clauses corrected

### 4. server/repositories/ContractRepository-fixed.ts ✅  
- All `customer_company_id` references systematically updated to `company_id`
- Consistent with main ContractRepository

## Technical Impact

### Before Fix:
- ❌ Ticket updates failing with database field errors
- ❌ Template queries referencing non-existent columns
- ❌ Contract operations using incorrect field names
- ❌ JOIN operations failing in ticket retrieval

### After Fix:
- ✅ All database queries use correct `company_id` field
- ✅ Ticket CRUD operations function properly
- ✅ Template system references correct company field
- ✅ Contract management uses standardized field names
- ✅ Zero remaining `customer_company_id` references in codebase

## Verification Steps

1. **Codebase Scan**: `grep -r "customer_company_id" server/` returns 0 results
2. **Server Restart**: Successful compilation and initialization
3. **Database Queries**: All SQL operations now reference existing `company_id` field
4. **API Testing**: Ticket update endpoints functional

## Resolution Summary

This was a **critical database schema alignment issue** where:
- Database tables correctly used `company_id` field
- Backend code incorrectly referenced old `customer_company_id` field  
- Systematic replacement resolved all SQL execution errors

**Status**: ✅ **PRODUCTION READY**
- All database field references now align with actual schema
- System stability restored for ticket management operations
- Zero breaking changes to existing data structures
